# audiofluidity-rss

A clear, simple Scala API for generating RSS, for general websites as well as for podcasts.

Support is present for most common RSS extensions, including all Apple Podcast "itunes" elements.

## Quickstart

Coming soon!

## Limitations

Although this library defines an informal AST for RSS, for now it only
generates XML, it does not consume and parse it back. 

Maybe someday if there's interest.

## Some useful RSS resources

More docs soon, I hope. But for now, I want to
bookmark some useful RSS resources:
